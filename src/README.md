# 🌲 siancodes.com — Portfolio & Engineering Journey

Hi — I’m **Siân**, a Software Engineer specialising in **Android (Kotlin), SDK development and full-stack product engineering**.  
This project is the source code for my personal website **siancodes.com** — a single-page React app with scroll-driven storytelling, built to act as my **public engineering portfolio + recruiter-friendly introduction**.

The site highlights:

✨ My professional experience  
✨ My technical skills & interests  
✨ Featured projects (work + personal)  
✨ My direction + career goals  
✨ Ways to contact / work with me

It’s designed to feel **calm, thoughtful and intentional** — reflecting how I work as an engineer.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn From This Project

This repo isn’t just a website — it’s also a learning journey.  
By exploring and running this project, you’ll understand:

### ✅ How modern React apps are structured
You’ll see how components, layout, data and theme are separated in a clean way that scales.

### ✅ How to use Vite for fast development
Vite gives you instant reloads and a simple build pipeline, without heavy config.

### ✅ How Material UI & Framer Motion work together
Material UI provides accessible UI components, and Framer Motion adds smooth entrance + scroll animations.

### ✅ A standard “Node project lifecycle”
You’ll use the same install → dev → build → preview workflow used in real teams.
